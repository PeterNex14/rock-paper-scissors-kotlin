# 🎮 Rock–Paper–Scissors in Kotlin

A simple console-based **Rock–Paper–Scissors game** written in Kotlin.  
Built as a beginner project to practice Kotlin basics such as input/output, conditionals, loops, and random number generation.

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Case-insensitive user input (e.g., `ROCK`, `rock`, `Rock` all work)
- ✅ Input validation (rejects invalid/typo choices)
- ✅ Random computer choice using Kotlin’s `random()`
- ✅ Winner determination (Player, Computer, or Tie)
- ✅ Clear console output

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Kotlin** – main programming language
- **IntelliJ IDEA** – IDE for development

## 📖 What I Learned
- How to use `readln()` for user input
- Validating inputs with a `while` loop
- Using `when` expressions for branching logic
- Generating random numbers in Kotlin
- Writing clean, documented code with comments

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add score tracking across multiple rounds
- Add "best of 3" / "best of 5" mode
- Improve UX with colored console output
- Add unit tests for game logic
